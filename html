      <h2> Services </h2>
        <p><i> Past, Present, Future Spreads - $5.00</i></p>
      <p> This is the most basic spread, quick and to the point! It is meant for querents that are seeking to know more about their current situation. </p>
        <p><i>Celtic Cross Spreads - $20.00</i></p>
      <p> A far more exploratory spread, it often takes upwards of 60 minutes to complete. The Celtic Cross focuses on an individual's fated outcome and best outcome. <br> Through 10 random cards, the querent is led to examine the different factors deciding their fate and how best to conduct them!</p>
        <p><i>Specialty Spreads - Prices Varies per Spread</i></p>
      <p> We offer multiple spread types on a case-by-case basis. These spreads focus on issues such as love, attachment, health, opportunities, and much more! <br> Let us know what you are seeking and we are quite likely to have something to match the need.  </p>

      <p><strong>This is what local artist, Dan Staples, had to say about their experience!</strong></p>
      <p><i>"Atticus is a magician. They are able to read cards very scientifically and carefully. For them, it is not a psychic service. It is a scientific performance." - Dan Staples </i></p>
        <p><strong>One of our regular querents that attends Tarot @ 10th Street had this to say:</strong></p>
      <p><i>"These readings are always handled quite carefully. A lot of Tarot practicioners are certain of their craft. Atticus, however, is relaxed and humble.<br>In their own words, they only want you to know yourself." - K.C. Martin</i></p>
      <p><strong>During our reading hours at 2018's Death Rattle Writers' Festival we were met with this kindness:</strong></p>
      <p><i>"This is exactly what I needed to experience. I have never had a reading before, but it feels like soul therapy. We need more services like this!" - June Lee</i></p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Boise-based and Idaho raised, Atticus Kirkham is a freelance author and data scientist. Their studies of esoteric mythology and psychometrics led them to Dr. Carl Jung and his work on archetypes. <br>One fateful day, a witch from the west came into contact with Atticus and read their Tarot. After an intense, hour-and-a-half long session Atticus was enamored by the power of the cards.</p>
    <p>That was three years ago now. In that time, Atticus has studied many forms of alchemical theory. Their purpose is to reconcile the science and the spirit of parascience. <br>They have studied Thoth decks, Rider-Waite, Smith-Waite, oracle cards, and many other divinatory instruments.</p>
    <p><strong>This is what Atticus has to say about their reading process:</strong></p>
    <p>"The Tarot is akin to a conscioius entity being channeled through the deck. The card reader is really only acting as a translator: Explaining symbols, icons, <br>and how they relate to the spread itself. The querent (The person being read) defines their own synchronicity and patterns. <br>There is no psychic exchange but instead a cooperative delving into the unconscious between two parties."</p>
    <p>"Ultimately, the purpose of Tarot and all divination is simple: To bring the actual self closer to the ideal self. <br>It is an act of healing, not prophecy. Prophecy is best left to supercomputers." - Atticus Kirkham </p>
